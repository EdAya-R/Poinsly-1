# Overview

Motivation:
Our motivation with Poinsly is to gain a better understanding of how to make a programming language.

### Description:
Poinsly is a programming language that helps to solve linear or quadratic equations similarly to a graphing calculator. It utilizes the SLY premade parser, lexer and interpreter. How it works is that you enter either a linear or quadratic equation like this 1x^2+-5x+4 or 2x+24 and it would give you the result of said equation and a corresponding graph.

### Requierements:
* Python 3.6 and higher
### Technology and Modules:
The software we used to make this language was Python through Anaconda since it was required in order to use SLY, Cmath, numpy and matplotlib
