# Overview

Motivation:
Our motivation with Poinsly is to gain a better understanding of how to make a programming language. Poinsly is a programming language that helps to solve linear or quadratic equations similarly to a graphing calculator. It utilizes the SLY premade parser, lexer and interpreter. How it works is that you enter either a linear or quadratic equation like this 1x^2+-5x+4 or 2x+24 and it would give you the result of said equation and a corresponding graph.
